# Policy Guardian Chrome Extension

Policy Guardian is a Chrome extension prototype built for the Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025. It keeps an eye on the pages you visit, detects when you're reading a Terms of Service or Privacy Policy, and uses Chrome's on-device AI APIs to highlight risky clauses.

## Background
Most users accept Terms of Service without reading them. Risky clauses‚Äîlike selling personal data, forced arbitration, or indefinite data retention‚Äîare easy to miss in dense legal text. Policy Guardian makes these clauses clear and concise by analysing policies with Chrome's Built-in AI APIs.

## Features

- üîç **Automatic detection** ‚Äì Heuristics watch the URL, titles, and headings to detect policy-like documents. The extension offers to scan the page when a match is found.
- üß† **On-device AI analysis** ‚Äì When available, the extension calls the Prompt API to request a structured JSON with suspicious clauses and risk levels. A summary is generated with the Summarizer API and clauses are rephrased for clarity to get rid of legal jargon using the Rewriter API.
- üõü **Risk heatmap** ‚Äì The popup renders a simple 1‚Äì5 score across categories such as data collection, third-party sharing, and dispute resolution.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Suspicious clause list** ‚Äì Shows short excerpts, the reason they were flagged, and (when possible) a plain-language rewrite from the AI model.
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Manual scan fallback** ‚Äì Trigger a scan from the popup even if the page was not automatically detected. Heuristic fallbacks keep working when built-in AI models are unavailable.

## APIs Used
- **Summarizer API** ‚Äì extracts bullet points from legal text.
- **Prompt API (LanguageModel)** ‚Äì enforces a structured JSON schema for consistent risk scoring.
- **Rewriter API** ‚Äì rewrites flagged text into plain English.

## Requirements
- Chrome 138+ desktop
- Disk space + RAM for model download
- Internet connection for the first download

## Folder structure
```
extension/
  manifest.json
  service_worker.js
  content-script.js
  popup/
    popup.html
    popup.js
    popup.css
```

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions`, and enable **Developer mode** in the top right corner.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension/` directory.
4. Visit any Terms of Service or Privacy Policy page. A floating ‚ÄúScan for risky clauses‚Äù button should appear. You can also open the extension popup and run a manual scan at any time.

## Development notes

- **Prompt shaping** ‚Äì `service_worker.js` requests structured JSON from the Prompt API to ensure the popup can render heatmaps and clause details without additional parsing.
- **Fallbacks** ‚Äì When AI APIs are disabled or error out (unsupported hardware, etc.), a keyword-based fallback is used for analysis.
- **State management** ‚Äì Tab-specific scan results are stored in `chrome.storage.session`, which survives service worker suspensions but clears automatically when the tab closes.
- **UI** ‚Äì The popup is written in vanilla JavaScript and listens for scan updates via runtime messages. The floating widget in the content script gives the user a proactive nudge without being intrusive.

## Limitations and next steps

- Large documents are truncated to stay within the Prompt API's token limits. Future versions could chunk documents and merge the results.
- Highlighting flagged clauses directly on the page would require more advanced text anchoring. Future versions would implement such cleaner integrations into the browsing experience.
